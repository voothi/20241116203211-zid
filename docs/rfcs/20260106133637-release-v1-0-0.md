# RFC - Release v1.0.0

**ZID:** 20260106133637
**Status:** Staging
**Request:** my request 20260106133637

## Implementation Details

### Analytics
The project was originally a single-file script `zid.py` with hardcoded timestamp logic and Russian comments. To prepare for a professional release, we identified the need for:
- Localization (English comments).
- Configurability (custom formats, prefixes/suffixes).
- Robustness (unit tests).
- Clean project structure.

### Decisions
1.  **Configuration System**: Implemented a minimal `config.ini` reader. Unlike the reference project which has complex slugification, this project remains focused on ZID generation.
2.  **Code Restructuring**: Refactored `zid.py` to move logic into `generate_zid()`. This allows mocking the configuration and time in tests without external dependencies.
3.  **Testing Strategy**: Adopted the `unittest` framework. Created a `tests/` directory to keep source and tests separate, following standard Python practices.
4.  **Minimalism**: "Taking out what we can" resulted in a configuration file with only 3 essential settings (`format`, `prefix`, `suffix`), ensuring the tool remains simple and fast.
